## Dev Registration

Build a web page that allows you to register developers, their technologies and experience.

- The page must have an entry for the developer's full name and a button to add a new technology.
- When clicking the button, an event must be triggered, creating a new line of inputs on the form containing:
  - a text field for the name of the technology
  - a group of “radio” buttons with experience time options (e.g. “0-2 years”, “3-4 years” and “5+ years”)
  - a remove button that should delete that line.
- The form must also have a register button that saves the dev's information in an array and clears the form. To test how it works, you can use a simple console.log()

For this exercise you must only use events added via javascript and the page must work without triggering a reload.
